# What Does the SimpleStorage Contract Do?

The `SimpleStorage` contract is a basic example of a Solidity smart contract for storing and retrieving numbers and associating them with names. Its main features are:

- **Store a Number:** You can store a single favorite number on the blockchain.
- **Retrieve the Number:** Anyone can view the currently stored number.
- **Add People:** You can add people by name and associate each with their favorite number. This information is stored in a dynamic array and a mapping for quick lookup.
- **Mapping:** The contract keeps a mapping from names to favorite numbers, allowing you to look up a person's favorite number by their name.

This contract is ideal for learning the basics of Solidity, including variables, structs, arrays, mappings, and simple functions.


# Simple Storage Solidity Project

This project contains a simple Solidity contract, deployment scripts, and tests for learning and experimenting with Ethereum smart contracts.

## How to Use

1. **Compile Contracts:**
   - Use your preferred Solidity toolchain (Remix, Hardhat, etc.) to compile the contracts in `contracts/`.

2. **Deploy Contracts:**
   - Use the scripts in `scripts/` to deploy the contracts. Update the contract name and constructor arguments as needed.

3. **Run Tests:**
   - Run the tests in `tests/` to verify contract functionality.
