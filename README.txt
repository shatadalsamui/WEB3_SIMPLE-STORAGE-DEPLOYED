Remix Default Workspace Overview

This workspace is generated by Remix IDE for easy Solidity development, testing, and deployment. It contains a well-structured project with contracts, scripts, and tests.


/contracts
  â””â”€ 1_SimpleStorage.sol             // Simple storage contract
  
/scripts
  â””â”€ deploy_with_ethers.ts            // Deploy using Ethers.js
  â””â”€ deploy_with_web3.ts              // Deploy using Web3.js
  â””â”€ deploy_with_hardhat.ts           // Deploy with Hardhat

/tests
  â””â”€ storage.test.js                  // JS tests for Storage
  â””â”€ Ballot_test.sol                  // Solidity tests for Ballot

How to Use


To deploy a contract, update the contract name and constructor args in the deployment scripts.

Right-click the script file in Remix and select 'Run'. Outputs appear in the terminal.

Ensure contracts are compiled before running scripts.


Supported Modules

Remix supports modules like ethers, web3, chai, remix, etc. For unsupported modules, errors will notify you.
